Media Downloader
================

Movies, Series, Music, Subtitles[#]_ , etc[#]_ downloader ... 

The main idea is to group two projects that I currently have, a rss bit
transmission feeder and a subtitle downloader, and also to allow the inclusion
of new sources and destinations.

A source is any service, library or application that could return a link to a
downloadable media file.

A destination is any application, library or service that will actually download
an application.

.. [#] I know, I know, subtitles are not media files.
.. [#] This make the project name even worst, right ?
